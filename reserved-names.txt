Say I own ghost.xxx, when people register a username, they get
username.ghost.xxx. Then when they register a project, they get
project.username.ghost.xxx.

But I want to keep a few yyy.ghost.xxx subdomain for special ghost services.
For instance, api.ghost.xxx or doc.ghost.xxx. So here is a list of such names
that I could want to use later. So those names can not be register as username.

Otherwise I should make available all of yyy.ghosted.xxx (or yyy.ghostapps.xxx,
...).

api
developer
developers
doc
git
noteed
static
www
