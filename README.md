Ghost -- Git hosting

(Nothing from the following text is true yet, but might be some day. Actually I
write some stuffs that are useless on their own but let me understand/practice
the concepts.)

Ghost is a Git repositories hosting suite written in Haskell (released under a
BSD3 license). Other such tools include Gitosis, Gitolite, and Gitorious.
